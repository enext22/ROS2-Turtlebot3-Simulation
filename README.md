Last Updated: Sep 9, 2025

## Current Functionality:
- Successfully generated an Artificial Potential Field (APF) Visualization for turtlebot3 generic world
- Ability to read and process robot sensor meas from /scan to identify obstacle positions

## In-Progress:
- Calculating APF determined path for turtlebot3 and publishing it to the simulation
- Creating launch file system to spawn multiple turtlebot3 agents in the same instance
- Displaying robot path in rviz2

## Tool Integrations:
- Gazebo
- rviz2
- Custom APF Visualization
